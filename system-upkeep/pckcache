# This script will clean out the pacman package cache in /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ and delete any orphans and their config files. 

sudo pacman -Sc
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)

# Warning:
# Only do this when certain that previous package versions are not required, for example for a later downgrade. 
# pacman -Sc only leaves the versions of packages which are currently installed available, 
# older versions would have to be retrieved through other means, such as the Archive.

# Use this script as a post update script --  maybe add it to the end of the sysupdate.
